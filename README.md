# Interfaces
RentalCar program using interface, object, classes and others c# concepts. 
The RentalCar program is a OOP based code focus on interface implementation. 
The main file is the interaction with the user where I make the objects instances and ask for the user inputs of data. The Entites folder has the entites classes and objects and the Services the services class, it's just  self explanatory. I'm still learning about C# programming but I'm happy with my self improvement.
